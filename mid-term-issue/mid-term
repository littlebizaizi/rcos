We are working for the time filter in YACS for these days.
But there're still 2 main issues we could not handle.

1. For the begin and end time of each section of course, we haven't find out how to read
  out the specific number of time. The things we get now is only the whole course array,
  which contain lots of session in it, and each session have several sections. The begin
  time and end time of each section of the course is right in there, but we haven't found 
  the way to get it. We may try to get it in the next course.

2. And the front-end side, we're assign to make a pop-up box that let users choose the 
  time they want. However, following by the tutorial on Google, we could not write out
  the correct code. Now I've already create a button and some box inside(not sure about 
  these boxes), but the page have no change when I click the button for some reason I
  need to find out in next class.
